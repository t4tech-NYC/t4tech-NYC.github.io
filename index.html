                  <div class="eventDescription"> Hacking//Hustling was a two-part event organized by Melissa Gira Grant and Danielle Blunt, hosted by the incredible team at Eyebeam. It's aim was to bridge gaps between the tech industry and sex worker communities after FOSTA/SESTA legislation.
                      The event kicked off with a panel of sex workers describing the impact this insidious law has had on their wellbeing and safety, and how the current tech industry has failed to advocate for their rights. The second day of the event was facilitated by us at t4tech,
                      a tactical skillshare around topics of digital privacy and counter-surveillance. We hosted workshops around Doxxing Self Defense, Social Media Lockdown, Installation and use of Tor and VPNs, and encrypted communication technologies. Find the slide decks and resources at
