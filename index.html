            <p>t4tech began in NYC as a series of free events to help out trans people in NYC looking for jobs and taking hold of their digital privacy and security. Dozens of workshops took place from 2017 to 2019, covering topics like anti-surveillance tactics, web development workshops, business skills for freelance technologists, data hygiene, and internet literacy. We even hosted a few fundraisers for incarcerated activists.</p>
            <p>After 2019, t4tech went on hiatus (the primary coordinator moved from the east to the west coast). Our collaborations with <a href="hackinghustling.org" target="_blank">Hacking//Hustling</a> took off, and most advocacy work, privacy consulting, and digital security trainings took place through them <3.</p>
            <p>Now it's 2023, and things certainly haven't gotten any better for the TGNC community in the US. Excuse our appearance as we slowly dust off our repos, websites, and training materials. Although the most pressing dangers facing the TGNC community today are very much happening offline, the last thing we need is digital threats emboldening the IRL ones. Stay safe out there <3.</p>

                  A hands on, beginner friendly workshop in source control using the git command line interface! An invaluable skill for developers of all kinds to have, but can also be an extremely useful tool for any kind of draft source controlling for creatives, activists, etc. We'll cover a foundational understanding of what source control means, how git enables that idea, how to collaborate with others, as well as navigating the dreaded (but inevitable) merge conflicts that can arise.

            <a href="./tgnc_security_personas_2_page.pdf"><h2>Digital Security & Virtual Privacy Personas Zine (Color)</h2></a>
            <p>This 2 page zine is print ready and intended to be distributed to anyone or anywhere that needs it. It's a brief guide on the types of threat models that are common to the TGNC community as well as some recommendations to keep those types of peoples safe. There's a ton of information jam packed into 2 pages, so it's not really meant to be a thorough educational resource on all the technologies listed, but more a starting point intended to give someone a knowledgeable list of things to research next.</p>
            <p>Printing instructions: print double sided on the short edge (most printers give that option on the pre-print screen), in either color or B/W. Fold in half down the middle, so that the "cover" page with the biggest letters is face up. It reads like a (very brief, 2 page) book.</p>
